# Cat-Dog-Classification
 This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images to learn and extract important visual features. The final model can predict the class of unseen images with high accuracy.
